I had diarrhea. I only had diarrhea for two days. The COVID-19 lasted for ten to 12 days and turned negative. During this period, I took ibuprofen. After turning negative, I went to the clinic and received a drop bottle of potassium supplement and another bottle I don’t know what it was called. The clinic also prescribed some cough medicine. I don’t know what it is called. Taking it makes me want to sleep. After taking it for a few days, my insomnia problem was relieved, but the cough was not cured.

After choking on pepper on June 12, I have been coughing intermittently. I have been walking a lot. After a long time, I have difficulty breathing, not enough air, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing. Two X-rays were taken at the end of June and July. The first time was normal, but the second time showed hyperinflation of the lungs. A pulmonary function test was performed on July 5, and the fev1/fvc was both around 71. After the bronchiectasis test, the fev1/fvc increased to 79%. The doctor prescribed fluticasone inhaler and told me to spray it twice in the morning and evening. The effect of medication is unstable, and the cough has improved, but I still have coughing and difficulty breathing even after walking quickly and reducing the dosage of medication. During this period, I had severe attacks four or five times when I went out. After seeing the doctor on August 16, I did a second lung function test. The fev1/fvc was still around 71, but there was little change after the bronchiectasis test, rising from 71 to 73%. On August 17th, I met with a specialist and switched to Symbicort Duspo 200 dosage form. I took the medicine regularly, spraying it twice in the morning and evening, and the effect was obvious. But after stopping it for two meals from last night to this morning, the symptoms of insufficient air and inability to open the airway recurred. I can’t tell whether it’s a psychological effect, but the subjective symptoms are still quite obvious. It’s hard to breathe in! Director Zhao, please tell me what’s going on based on my medical history. I used to have coughs without colds and chest tightness and shortness of breath, but I never had difficulty breathing. Why did I suddenly need to take asthma medicine? Is this airway inflammation, or is a foreign body entering the trachea after being choked?

No. 4 felt uncomfortable in his throat and had yellow phlegm. He took cephalosporins for about 5 days in a row, and also took cephalosporins and cough medicine in the middle of the day. I have had a hoarse voice for about a week. Every morning I wake up with a sore throat and yellow flakes and lumpy phlegm. I cough every day either a lot or with stuck phlegm. Because I have been taking antipyretic and cough medicine. After a week, my voice basically recovered, but my cough is still the same with less phlegm. I have been coughing a little bit, but in the past two days I started to feel that I would cough more when I lay down, and I would get up and cough a few times at night. It has been more than 10 days. I was afraid of pneumonia, so I came to the hospital for a check-up. The blood level was high. I want the experts to see the X-ray results. I am in In January this year, a CT scan was also done in China and Japan. These problems were not found. There were more problems with the X-ray taken just half a year ago, and small nodules appeared. The emergency doctor looked at the X-ray and said that my lungs should be fine this time. They are all old. The problem is probably bronchitis. I started infusion yesterday and was told to give it for 3 days. For further treatment, I came here for consultation.chronic disease is Nonedisease history is emptysurgery history is Noneradiotherapy and chemotherapy history is Noneallergy history is Nonemajor illness is Nonemedication usage is As shown in the picture below, infusions and medicines are only allowed to be taken, amoxicillin, but all others are taken.	14

I had a severe cough at the beginning of this year . I went to our local Guang'an People's Hospital on January 17 this year. A CT scan showed that there was a problem with my lungs. The doctor thought it was pneumonia or tuberculosis. I stayed there for a few days. In Tianyuan, I did a fiberscope examination. The doctor said it was not tuberculosis. I took moxifloxacin orally for ten days. After a reexamination, the lesions were obviously absorbed and the cough gradually improved. The doctor said there was no need to worry about it. He suggested that a reexamination be done in six months. . On April 30, during a physical examination at our local Guang'an People's Hospital, it was found that there was something wrong with the CT scan of my lungs, but I didn't have any symptoms. I went to West China Hospital on May 16. The respiratory doctor suspected pneumonia or tuberculosis and prescribed several boxes of Jundi faropenem sodium tablets and nasturtium capsules. I took them for three weeks. On June 19, a local CT scan showed that There was still a problem with the lungs. The doctor suspected allergic alveolitis, but was not sure and said further tests were needed. On June 21st, I went to see Dr. Xu in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of West China Hospital. Dr. Xu considered that it was a viral tuberculosis infection and said that he needed to be checked. Then he did a blood test and the TB-IGRA  test showed positive. Dr. Xu said that if the result is positive, he should be referred to the tuberculosis department, but your number has not been available recently. I can only contact you online at Good Doctor. I had endobronchial tuberculosis when I was twenty years old, and I was also treated at West China Hospital at that time. Yes, I have recovered after taking medicine for a year. This time the result showed positive. I wonder if it can be confirmed that it is tuberculosis? I have had no symptoms in the past few months, but my back has been uncomfortable in the past week or two. I will send you the relevant information, please help me diagnose it, thank you!	allergy history is None	major illness is empty	0	33.0	156.0	50.0	pneumonia	wanted help is  I would like to ask if I can go directly to your outpatient clinic for treatment.

She developed a fever on the night of the 10th and tested positive for the new coronavirus antigen in the early morning of May 11th. The high fever was 39.7 degrees, which lasted for 24 hours. During this period, I took Motrin and ibuprofen sustained-release capsules, and 5 domestic Azivudine tablets. On May 12, I had a recurring high fever, basically between 38.5 and 39.7. Medication is the same as on the 11th. It was 37.5 in the morning on May 13, and it was above 38 degrees in the afternoon. During this period, I occasionally coughed and spit out yellow phlegm. I went to the Yuyao Second People's Hospital to see a doctor in the afternoon and was treated with salt water for two days. Temperature is normal. I didn’t take Azivudine tablets during this period. On the afternoon of May 15, the temperature rose again to 37.5 degrees. I went to Yuyao People's Hospital and had a routine blood test, a biochemical test, and a CT scan, which showed pneumonia. Mild inflammation, I was asked to recheck in 5 days. There is no other medicine, so I am required to continue taking Azivudine tablets + loquat cough syrup. The temperature reached 39.3 degrees at night. I took 20 ml of Motrin and the fever subsided to 38.6 the next day. I slept all day. When I wake up, the temperature is basically above 38.5, so I take antipyretics. On the morning of May 16, the temperature reached 37.4 degrees without any medication, and in the afternoon it rose to 37.2 degrees. On the morning of May 17, the temperature reached 36.8 degrees. The temperature basically didn't rise at all. On May 20, I took a shower and washed my hair, and on the afternoon of May 21, I had a CT scan, which showed that there was more inflammation than before. It rained a little on the way back, and I took a shower again. It was 37.1 degrees at night, and it became normal again half an hour later. I went to work on the 22nd. I lay down for a while in the morning. I was so weak that I broke into a cold sweat. I wanted to vomit but didn't.

She developed a fever on the night of the 10th and tested positive for the new coronavirus antigen in the early morning of May 11th. The high fever was 39.7 degrees, which lasted for 24 hours. During this period, I took Motrin and ibuprofen sustained-release capsules, and 5 domestic Azivudine tablets. On May 12, I had a recurring high fever, basically between 38.5 and 39.7. Medication is the same as on the 11th. It was 37.5 in the morning on May 13, and it was above 38 degrees in the afternoon. During this period, I occasionally coughed and spit out yellow phlegm. I went to the Yuyao Second People's Hospital to see a doctor in the afternoon and was treated with salt water for two days. Temperature is normal. I didn’t take Azivudine tablets during this period. On the afternoon of May 15, the temperature rose again to 37.5 degrees. I went to Yuyao People's Hospital and had a routine blood test, a biochemical test, and a CT scan, which showed pneumonia. Mild inflammation, I was asked to recheck in 5 days. There is no other medicine, so I am required to continue taking Azivudine tablets + loquat cough syrup. The temperature reached 39.3 degrees at night. I took 20 ml of Motrin and the fever subsided to 38.6 the next day. I slept all day. When I wake up, the temperature is basically above 38.5, so I take antipyretics. On the morning of May 16, the temperature reached 37.4 degrees without any medication, and in the afternoon it rose to 37.2 degrees. On the morning of May 17, the temperature reached 36.8 degrees.

The fever has subsided, but she still has chest pain and tightness, and has paroxysmal coughing and wheezing and white sticky sputum every day. Blood oxygen saturation is normal. A follow-up blood test in early July showed only a slightly higher number of neutrophils, and a follow-up CT scan showed interstitial inflammation in the lungs. Azithromycin was given intravenously infusion for 5 days.

He was given ceftriaxone sodium for three days. On May 28, he had a fever for the first time with a peak of 39.5. He went to the hospital to do a blood routine and found no problems with mycoplasma and COVID-19. The fever went away after two days. Reduce fever. On June 10, I had a fever for two days, with the highest fever reaching 38.5°C. The cough subsided on its own after two days without going to the hospital for a blood test. Five days later, the cough improved. On June 27, the fever peaked at 39.5 degrees again. When I went to the hospital for a blood test, the regular doctor said it was normal and there was no big problem. The fever went away after three days! I had a fever again on July 21st. The highest fever reaches 40 degrees! The white blood cell count was 23. The doctor said it was a bacterial infection and he was given ceftriaxone for three days. The fever completely subsided in three days and the blood test was normal again. But there were white spots on my throat. The doctor said it was angina. After I went home, I sprayed Houjian's Pediatric Pharyngitis Granules! Throat herpes disappeared after 7 days! On August 9, the fever reached a maximum of 39.5 degrees!

I did not go to the hospital this time. I want to know from you first. If the child has been in the past two months, he needs to go to the hospital for further treatment. What about the inspection? I hope the professor can give some guidance.  My child took amoxicillin today. There are red spots on the child’s arms. Is it an allergy to the drug? Professor Jiang, what does the high erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the blood test yesterday mean? I read on the platform that continuous high fever might be Kawasaki disease?

Chest CT re-examination on April 24 showed post-cardiac surgery changes, please combine it with clinical practice; lesions in the upper lobe of the left lung showed an increase in solid components compared with the previous film , so it is recommended that further clinical examination be combined. There is a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion, which is less than the previous effusion; bilateral pleural hypertrophy and adhesions; aortic sclerosis; multiple space-occupying lesions in the liver, it is recommended to enhance CT examination; for space-occupying lesions in the spleen, it is recommended to enhance CT examination. I completed the PETCT on June 19 and the results have been uploaded. I complained of weakness in both lower limbs and no other special discomfort.

From 2021 to 2022, I received follow-up treatment at the respiratory medicine department of a local tertiary hospital. The respiratory medicine doctor said that interstitial inflammation was considered, and he took prednisone tablets, Bailing capsules, and omeprazole enteric-coated tablets during this period. During the follow-up period, the nodule shadow shrank, but not significantly. The last examination was on July 13, 2022. At that time, the doctor said that considering the inflammation caused by chemical substances, there would be no need for follow-up examinations in the future.

He is now in the United States. Some time before the trip, I adjusted my diet at home. I usually went to bed before 10:30 at night, woke up around 7-8 in the morning, and ate very regularly. Until half a month ago, I planned to travel for seven days. The weather was very dry and hot. The place where I traveled had a desert climate, and the highest temperature reached 40 degrees. I didn’t drink a lot of water at that time. I was on my period at the time of the trip. I wake up at 8-10am every morning and go to bed between 12pm-2pm. I had Starbucks coffee or latte every day of the trip. I brought home-made breakfast for the first four days of the trip and ensured at least two meals. However, sometimes after breakfast, I didn’t eat until 7 or 8 o’clock in the evening. During the next three days of the trip, I would eat with my family. Sometimes I would eat at one or two o'clock in the afternoon. One meal would last the whole day, and I would have some bread latte in the afternoon. I woke up in the middle of the night two days before the tour. My heart was beating very fast and I felt uncomfortable and blocked. I had difficulty breathing, so I stood up and walked around. I stayed in the bathroom for more than two hours and kept hiccupping. It was the kind of empty burp that had no smell and I felt a lot of gas in my stomach. After I finished burping, I felt that my breathing was much normal and there was nothing blocking it. On fire. The first week after returning from traveling was very confusing. I would burp a lot from time to time and order takeaways. My bowel movements were irregular and difficult to pass. The only control is eating within eight hours. In the second week after returning from the trip, I would eat prunes and chia seeds in the morning to promote bowel movements, and I stopped eating them until they were almost regular and smooth. Eat at least two meals a day, oatmeal as a base and steamed buns for breakfast, and some very light carbohydrates + protein + green vegetables at noon and afternoon. However, I still go to bed late, usually between 12 and 1:30, and wake up late in the morning. My stomach feels very bloated, full and uncomfortable. I am not very hungry. I may feel full after drinking some water in the morning. I also keep having intermittent hiccups, which last for more than ten minutes. Every time I hiccup, it is filled with gas and water in my stomach. Even after defecation, my stomach still feels watery and bloated. During this period, I took chewable tablets to aid digestion, and things improved a little bit. In the middle of the night last Saturday, I kept getting up to urinate very frequently. Every time I peeed a little, it still hurt a little. I didn't sleep well at all. I started taking Sanjin Tablets + American anti-inflammatory drugs on Sunday morning. I feel pain down there after standing for a long time. Although I want to promote urination, I drink too much water and my stomach becomes bloated and uncomfortable. I feel pain in my lower abdomen when I urinate frequently and I also have hiccups all the time. I dare not drink too much water. I have been taking the medicine for five days now. I woke up less frequently last night but did do so three or four times. I don't urinate much every time. When I woke up this morning, my stomach was still very bloated and full. I felt full without eating anything and kept hiccupping. I felt my stomach growling after eating oatmeal in the morning, but it felt much better after farting.

On the day of the infection on Saturday, my symptoms were as bad as bone pain, nausea, headache, slight cough, etc. I went directly to the clinic for injections of clindamycin, ribavirin and dexamethasone. My symptoms have become much milder, but my condition is not particularly good, because my family basically has no symptoms after being vaccinated against COVID-19 for two days. I am the most severe one in the whole family, and I have been vaccinated for four days in total! I basically stay in bed every day. I haven't had any injections since yesterday, and I feel fine. I can walk around the house, but I feel tired easily. During this period, I have been coughing occasionally, with a slight cough like a scratchy throat. Yesterday evening, when I coughed, I felt like a lump of phlegm had exploded in my chest. My chest was exploding with pain. From then on, my cough obviously got worse. I always wanted to cough when I went to bed last night. Most of the time I could suppress it, but every time My chest feels like it's exploding when I cough.

Can't swallow without eating or drinking. Admitted to community hospital on June 1st. It was only at this time that the antigen test was positive. It was his first infection and he was also vaccinated. Because I was not with them, they dictated that the community hospital used antipyretic and cough medicines, but even after taking the antipyretics, the fever continued to be high, always over 39 degrees, and dropped to around 38 after taking the medicine. On the 5th, I changed hospitals at my insistence. A CT was taken. When I rushed back, I saw that the hospital infusion bottle had dimi and potassium written on it. The nurse said his potassium was very low. Now the cough has improved significantly but the fever is still high. The body temperature can be maintained at around 37 degrees during the infusion.

Afterwards, I took Suhuang Cough Capsules for seven days, and I got a little better. I started to cough up white phlegm. Now I still cough occasionally, and every time I cough up white phlegm, my throat is still a little dry and itchy. I can’t stop coughing after eating something irritating or encountering air conditioning. , how can the doctor solve my cough?

I had a fever for about three days, with a maximum temperature of 39 degrees. I took ibuprofen for two days and pax medicine for five days. Now my temperature is normal. I still cough a lot at night. I have been feeling a little sick for a while. I have been coughing continuously and short of breath. I had a lot of phlegm in the past two nights, which was all white. Occasionally, it was thick phlegm once or twice, which was a little yellowish. I had a CT scan on the 17th and everything was normal. Dr. Qian heard it yesterday. It's normal for a while. I have a lot of medicine at home now and I don't know how to take it. What I'm taking now is Nianji'an and Qeno. Last night I felt that there was a little less phlegm than the night before, and the cough was also a little less. , but there are still more than 10 coughs at night. I basically don’t cough after falling asleep. When I wake up, I feel that my throat is very itchy and I want to cough. Sometimes when I cough, I haven’t finished coughing in the front, and I want to cough again and I feel short of breath. , asked the doctor if it could be asthma? The doctor prescribed several asthma medicines for me, but then I saw that asthma seemed to have wheezing sounds, which didn’t seem like it to me, and I didn’t dare to take them. What medicine should the doctor take in my case? Do you need to adjust your medication? I have white phlegm when I cough, but it is less than the previous two days. I don’t cough much during the day, but I cough more at night. Do I need to adjust my medicine? Because I have a throat ulcer, the doctor gave me cefaclor. I haven't taken it yet. Do I need to take it? The Department of Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Infectious Diseases have prescribed a lot of medicines for me. Now I am afraid that taking too many medicines will damage my liver and kidney function, so you can take a look at which of these medicines I can use and which ones need to be adjusted. The main symptom now is that my throat is still a little sticky. It hurts because I have a throat ulcer, but it has improved a bit. The most important thing is that I still cough more at night and have a lot of white phlegm, but it has reduced. Thank you  I would like to ask the doctor if it is okay if there are casts in the urine. ? I have been suffering from proteinuria and occult blood recently. Is this related to the fact that I have stopped taking ibuprofen? Is it related to the new crown? What should I pay attention to, thank you  I am taking antibiotics now, Xikelao, for the sixth day. During the day, there is white phlegm. When I get up in the morning, the first mouthful of phlegm is a bit thick. It's just a little bit, localized, thick phlegm. Does this rare guest always want to continue eating? If I have thick phlegm, do I need to continue taking antibiotics? Now the main ones are Jiji syrup Nian Ji'an and Cheno, and Shiklao  After taking Shiklao, the cough and phlegm were obviously reduced a lot, but there seemed to be no change during this period after taking it. Big, I cough more when there is a little bit of wind. Normally, it gradually decreases, but I still often have coughs. Mainly because I feel a deeper cough, and then the phlegm is a bit sticky, but after taking antibiotics, the cough becomes obvious. Reduced, sputum decreased. In this situation, can antibiotics still be used? If there is thick phlegm, do I still need to continue taking antibiotics? Most of the time during the day, there is white sputum. The first mouthful in the morning was a little thick.  The nucleic acid has turned negative because I have sleep apnea syndrome at night. I use a ventilator at night. Is it possible to use a ventilator? , causing bronchitis or pneumonia. Now my throat is itchy whenever I talk, and I have to cough without talking. The coughing has been reduced a lot. Some doctors said it was pharyngitis, but I feel a bit like bronchitis. Recently, the doctor will listen to it every day. After hearing this, the doctor said there was no problem. The blood test is now normal. Even the chest X-ray taken on the 14th and the CT scan taken on the 17th were normal. I coughed more during this period and did not go for a test. Is it necessary to do it again? Going for a chest X-ray? I'm afraid there will be too much radiation, thank you  Doctor, my throat gets itchy and I cough easily when I talk. Is this bronchitis? Will it cause pneumonia? I think there is a ventilator for sleep apnea syndrome. I am worried about whether this will cause pneumonia. Thank you  What is the cause of the thick phlegm this morning? Is it bronchitis? Is there a bacterial infection in the bronchial tubes?  The otolaryngologist saw it here and said that it was a bit of pharyngitis, and then most of the previous throat ulcers were absorbed, and there were still a few scattered ones.  There was still one yesterday morning. There is a little bit of thick phlegm. There is no thick phlegm this morning. The cough has significantly reduced after taking antibiotics. There was still a little bit yesterday, but the cough is still quite deep. It is mainly white phlegm during the day and very little at night. It is gone this morning. I have thick phlegm. I drove for an hour yesterday and then sweated a lot. It was hot and my throat was a little itchy. There was a lot of phlegm in my throat last night. It was all white phlegm. I took a chest X-ray today. Can I see it? Pneumonia and bronchitis? I feel a bit bronchitis, and the phlegm is thick when I cough. If there is no thick phlegm in the morning, can I stop using Xiclau? Today is already the 7th day of taking antibiotics, thank you  Do I have a little bronchitis? Can it be seen on a chest X-ray? Thank you. The medicines I am taking now are Shiklau Nianji'an, Jizhiji syrup, Cherno, watermelon cream lozenges, salt water gargle, citrus ice plum tablets, and Sibi chloramine gargle  Can Qingyan Dropping Pills be used? The ingredients here are polyethylene glycol. Is this alcohol? I am taking antibiotics, can I use this medicine?  Before getting up in the morning, there was thick phlegm in the first mouthful, a small part, and the rest was white. There was a blood streak in the sputum this morning. The otolaryngologist looked at it and it may be in the nose or throat. , the doctor in the Department of Respiratory Medicine here asked me to take Xiclau for another week. He said that the sputum in the morning was a little yellow, which may be a little red due to the blood streaks, or that it was a little red after eating the Nianjian. The last picture is from today. The first few pictures are of the first mouthful of phlegm in the morning a few days ago. The other days are not white phlegm. Do I still need to take Xiclau for another week? If there is no more yellow phlegm, can I stop? Now I have a itchy throat and want to cough when I talk.

Mainly because I feel a deeper cough, and then the phlegm is a bit sticky, but after taking antibiotics, the cough becomes obvious. Reduced, sputum decreased. In this situation, can antibiotics still be used? If there is thick phlegm, do I still need to continue taking antibiotics? Most of the time during the day, there is white sputum. The first mouthful in the morning was a little thick.  The nucleic acid has turned negative because I have sleep apnea syndrome at night. I use a ventilator at night. Is it possible to use a ventilator? , causing bronchitis or pneumonia. Now my throat is itchy whenever I talk, and I have to cough without talking. The coughing has been reduced a lot. Some doctors said it was pharyngitis, but I feel a bit like bronchitis. Recently, the doctor will listen to it every day. After hearing this, the doctor said there was no problem. The blood test is now normal. Even the chest X-ray taken on the 14th and the CT scan taken on the 17th were normal. I coughed more during this period and did not go for a test. Is it necessary to do it again? Going for a chest X-ray? I'm afraid there will be too much radiation, thank you  Doctor, my throat gets itchy and I cough easily when I talk. Is this bronchitis? Will it cause pneumonia? I think there is a ventilator for sleep apnea syndrome. I am worried about whether this will cause pneumonia. Thank you  What is the cause of the thick phlegm this morning? Is it bronchitis? Is there a bacterial infection in the bronchial tubes?  The otolaryngologist saw it here and said that it was a bit of pharyngitis, and then most of the previous throat ulcers were absorbed, and there were still a few scattered ones.  There was still one yesterday morning. There is a little bit of thick phlegm. There is no thick phlegm this morning. The cough has significantly reduced after taking antibiotics. There was still a little bit yesterday, but the cough is still quite deep. It is mainly white phlegm during the day and very little at night. It is gone this morning. I have thick phlegm. I drove for an hour yesterday and then sweated a lot. It was hot and my throat was a little itchy. There was a lot of phlegm in my throat last night. It was all white phlegm. I took a chest X-ray today. Can I see it? Pneumonia and bronchitis? I feel a bit bronchitis, and the phlegm is thick when I cough. If there is no thick phlegm in the morning, can I stop using Xiclau? Today is already the 7th day of taking antibiotics, thank you  Do I have a little bronchitis? Can it be seen on a chest X-ray? Thank you. The medicines I am taking now are Shiklau Nianji'an, Jizhiji syrup, Cherno, watermelon cream lozenges, salt water gargle, citrus ice plum tablets, and Sibi chloramine gargle  Can Qingyan Dropping Pills be used? The ingredients here are polyethylene glycol. Is this alcohol? I am taking antibiotics, can I use this medicine?  Before getting up in the morning, there was thick phlegm in the first mouthful, a small part, and the rest was white. There was a blood streak in the sputum this morning. The otolaryngologist looked at it and it may be in the nose or throat. , the doctor in the Department of Respiratory Medicine here asked me to take Xiclau for another week. He said that the sputum in the morning was a little yellow, which may be a little red due to the blood streaks, or that it was a little red after eating the Nianjian. The last picture is from today. The first few pictures are of the first mouthful of phlegm in the morning a few days ago. The other days are not white phlegm. Do I still need to take Xiclau for another week? If there is no more yellow phlegm, can I stop? Now I have a itchy throat and want to cough when I talk.

The above symptoms appeared again in early November 2022, and later I coughed, and there was soreness in the middle and upper part of the right chest near the front axillary line. I had traction pain that lasted for about ten days. I was infected with new coronavirus pneumonia again on December 18, 2022. My cough never got better and lasted until January 16, 2023. A CT scan showed a nodule in the right upper lung. The doctor felt that the shape was not good, and then another I retrieved the CT chest X-ray taken on February 24, 2020, and found that it was there at that time. Compared with the size, there was not much change. Because the Chinese New Year was approaching, I only took anti-inflammatory drugs and budesonide atomization for a few days. The cough stopped and improved after a few days. On May 11, 2023, I went to Lianyungang First People's Hospital for a CT re-examination, which showed multiple nodules in the right lung and mixed density nodules in the posterior segment of the right upper lung, with a size of about 11*8mm. On May 16, 2023, I followed the advice of the tuberculosis doctor and tried anti-tuberculosis treatment for 2 months. I was infected with new coronavirus pneumonia again on May 18, 2023. I had no fever, mainly pharyngeal symptoms, vomiting white and sticky sputum, and paroxysmal coughing. The cough is worse than before. It has improved. I had seen an otolaryngologist before and it was revealed that the pharyngitis was severe.

The tuberculosis doctor then increased the dosage of rifapentine to twice a week, instead of once every five days. A re-examination on June 12 showed that the ground glass part of the middle lobe of the right lung was enlarged and had new growth. The remaining lesions were unchanged.

A lung CT scan at that time showed multiple nodules in both lungs and two ground glass nodules, the larger of which was about 9mm in length and diameter. The doctor told me that I was not infected with tuberculosis. I was infected with COVID-19 in early January this year and recovered within a week. In March, I had a continuous cough for nearly 20 days with phlegm, and chest pain symptoms that have continued since last year. It is especially severe when lying on my side or taking deep breaths. I took another lung CT scan and was diagnosed with the possibility of tuberculosis . The ppd was strong and positive due to the CT scan. It showed obvious manifestations of tuberculosis, so it was decided to directly use quadruple drug for diagnostic treatment. After one week of treatment, the symptoms of cough and phlegm disappeared, and the chest pain symptoms also gradually reduced with the advancement of medication, and now they have almost disappeared. From the beginning to the end, the patient never showed any typical symptoms of tuberculosis such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and low fever. A reexamination after 60 days of medication showed that some of the lesions in the lungs were relieved, but the report contained content that had not appeared before and had not yet been diagnosed by a doctor.

I had a fever for about three days, with a maximum temperature of 39 degrees. I took ibuprofen for two days and pax medicine for five days. Now my temperature is normal. I still cough a lot at night. I have been feeling a little sick for a while. I have been coughing continuously and short of breath. I had a lot of phlegm in the past two nights, which was all white. Occasionally, it was thick phlegm once or twice, which was a little yellowish. I had a CT scan on the 17th and everything was normal. Dr. Qian heard it yesterday. It's normal for a while. I have a lot of medicine at home now and I don't know how to take it. What I'm taking now is Nian Ji'an and Qie Nuo. Last night I felt that there was a little less phlegm than the night before, and the cough was also a little less. , but there are still more than 10 coughs at night. I basically don’t cough after falling asleep. When I wake up, I feel that my throat is very itchy and I want to cough. Sometimes when I cough, I haven’t finished coughing in the front, and I want to cough again and I feel short of breath. , asked the doctor if it could be asthma? The doctor prescribed several asthma medicines for me, but then I saw that asthma seemed to have wheezing sounds, which didn’t seem like it to me, and I didn’t dare to take them. What medicine should the doctor take in my case? Do you need to adjust your medication? I have white phlegm when I cough, but it is less than the previous two days. I don’t cough much during the day, but I cough more at night. Do I need to adjust my medicine? Because I have a throat ulcer, the doctor gave me cefaclor. I haven't taken it yet. Do I need to take it? The Department of Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Infectious Diseases have prescribed a lot of medicines for me. Now I am afraid that taking too many medicines will damage my liver and kidney function, so you can take a look at which of these medicines I can use and which ones need to be adjusted. The main symptom now is that my throat is still a little sticky. It hurts because I have a throat ulcer, but it has improved a bit. The most important thing is that I still cough more at night and have a lot of white phlegm, but it has reduced. Thank you  I would like to ask the doctor if it is okay if there are casts in the urine. ? I have been suffering from proteinuria and occult blood recently. Is this related to the fact that I have stopped taking ibuprofen? Is it related to the new crown? What should I pay attention to, thank you  I am taking antibiotics now, Xikelao, for the sixth day. During the day, there is white phlegm. When I get up in the morning, the first mouthful of phlegm is a bit thick. It's just a little bit, localized, thick phlegm. Does this rare guest always want to continue eating? If I have thick phlegm, do I need to continue taking antibiotics? Now the main ones are Jiji syrup Nian Ji'an and Cheno, and Shiklao  After taking Shiklao, the cough and phlegm were obviously reduced a lot, but there seemed to be no change during this period after taking it. Big, the cough will be more when there is a little wind, but normally it will gradually lessen, but I still often have a cough, mainly because I feel this deeper cough, and then the phlegm is a bit sticky, but after taking antibiotics, the cough becomes obvious Reduced, sputum decreased. In this situation, can antibiotics still be used? If there is thick phlegm, do I still need to continue taking antibiotics? Most of the time during the day, there is white sputum. The first mouthful in the morning was a little thick.  The nucleic acid has turned negative because I have sleep apnea syndrome at night. I use a ventilator at night. Is it possible to use a ventilator? , causing bronchitis or pneumonia. Now my throat is itchy whenever I talk, and I have to cough without talking. The coughing has been reduced a lot. Some doctors said it was pharyngitis, but I feel a bit like bronchitis. Recently, the doctor will listen to it every day. After hearing this, the doctor said there was no problem. The blood test is now normal. Even the chest X-ray taken on the 14th and the CT scan taken on the 17th were both normal. I coughed more during this period and did not go for a test. Is it necessary to do it again? Going for a chest X-ray? I'm afraid there will be too much radiation, thank you  Doctor, my throat gets itchy and I cough easily when I talk. Is this bronchitis? Will it cause pneumonia? I think there is a ventilator for sleep apnea syndrome. I am worried about whether this will cause pneumonia. Thank you  What is the cause of the thick phlegm this morning? Is it bronchitis? Is there a bacterial infection in the bronchial tubes?  The otolaryngologist saw it here and said that it was a bit of pharyngitis, and then most of the previous throat ulcers were absorbed, and there were still a few scattered ones.  There was still one yesterday morning. There is a little bit of thick phlegm. There is no thick phlegm this morning. The cough has significantly reduced after taking antibiotics. There was still a little bit yesterday, but the cough is still quite deep. It is mainly white phlegm during the day and very little at night. It is gone this morning. I have thick phlegm. I drove for an hour yesterday and then sweated a lot. It was hot and my throat was a little itchy. There was a lot of phlegm in my throat last night. It was all white phlegm. I took a chest X-ray today. Can I see it? Pneumonia and bronchitis? I feel a bit bronchitis, and the phlegm is thick when I cough. If there is no thick phlegm in the morning, can I stop using Xiclau? Today is already the 7th day of taking antibiotics, thank you  Do I have a little bronchitis? Can it be seen on a chest X-ray? Thank you, the medicines I am taking now are Shiklau Nian Ji'an, Jizhijiang Syrup, Cherno, Watermelon Cream Lozenges, Salt Water Gargle, Citrus Bingmei Tablets, Sibi Chloramine Gargle  Can Qingyan Dropping Pills be used?

Sometimes when I cough, I haven’t finished coughing in the front, and I want to cough again and I feel short of breath. , asked the doctor if it could be asthma? The doctor prescribed several asthma medicines for me, but then I saw that asthma seemed to have wheezing sounds, which didn’t seem like it to me, and I didn’t dare to take them. What medicine should the doctor take in my case? Do you need to adjust your medication? I have white phlegm when I cough, but it is less than the previous two days. I don’t cough much during the day, but I cough more at night. Do I need to adjust my medicine? Because I have a throat ulcer, the doctor gave me cefaclor. I haven't taken it yet. Do I need to take it? The Department of Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Infectious Diseases have prescribed a lot of medicines for me. Now I am afraid that taking too many medicines will damage my liver and kidney function, so you can take a look at which of these medicines I can use and which ones need to be adjusted. The main symptom now is that my throat is still a little sticky. It hurts because I have a throat ulcer, but it has improved a bit. The most important thing is that I still cough more at night and have a lot of white phlegm, but it has reduced. Thank you  I would like to ask the doctor if it is okay if there are casts in the urine. ? I have been suffering from proteinuria and occult blood recently. Is this related to the fact that I have stopped taking ibuprofen? Is it related to the new crown? What should I pay attention to, thank you  I am taking antibiotics now, Xikelao, for the sixth day. During the day, there is white phlegm. When I get up in the morning, the first mouthful of phlegm is a bit thick. It's just a little bit, localized, thick phlegm. Does this rare guest always want to continue eating? If I have thick phlegm, do I need to continue taking antibiotics? Now the main ones are Jiji syrup Nian Ji'an and Cheno, and Shiklao  After taking Shiklao, the cough and phlegm were obviously reduced a lot, but there seemed to be no change during this period after taking it. Big, the cough will be more when there is a little wind, but normally it will gradually lessen, but I still often have a cough, mainly because I feel this deeper cough, and then the phlegm is a bit sticky, but after taking antibiotics, the cough becomes obvious Reduced, sputum decreased. In this situation, can antibiotics still be used? If there is thick phlegm, do I still need to continue taking antibiotics? Most of the time during the day, there is white sputum. The first mouthful in the morning was a little thick.  The nucleic acid has turned negative because I have sleep apnea syndrome at night. I use a ventilator at night. Is it possible to use a ventilator? , causing bronchitis or pneumonia. Now my throat is itchy whenever I talk, and I have to cough without talking. The coughing has been reduced a lot. Some doctors said it was pharyngitis, but I feel a bit like bronchitis. Recently, the doctor will listen to it every day. After hearing this, the doctor said there was no problem. The blood test is now normal. Even the chest X-ray taken on the 14th and the CT scan taken on the 17th were both normal. I coughed more during this period and did not go for a test. Is it necessary to do it again? Going for a chest X-ray? I'm afraid there will be too much radiation, thank you  Doctor, my throat gets itchy and I cough easily when I talk. Is this bronchitis? Will it cause pneumonia? I think there is a ventilator for sleep apnea syndrome. I am worried about whether this will cause pneumonia. Thank you  What is the cause of the thick phlegm this morning? Is it bronchitis? Is there a bacterial infection in the bronchial tubes?  The otolaryngologist saw it here and said that it was a bit of pharyngitis, and then most of the previous throat ulcers were absorbed, and there were still a few scattered ones.  There was still one yesterday morning. There is a little bit of thick phlegm. There is no thick phlegm this morning. The cough has significantly reduced after taking antibiotics. There was still a little bit yesterday, but the cough is still quite deep. It is mainly white phlegm during the day and very little at night. It is gone this morning. I have thick phlegm. I drove for an hour yesterday and then sweated a lot. It was hot and my throat was a little itchy. There was a lot of phlegm in my throat last night. It was all white phlegm. I took a chest X-ray today. Can I see it? Pneumonia and bronchitis? I feel a bit bronchitis, and the phlegm is thick when I cough. If there is no thick phlegm in the morning, can I stop using Xiclau? Today is already the 7th day of taking antibiotics, thank you  Do I have a little bronchitis? Can it be seen on a chest X-ray? Thank you, the medicines I am taking now are Shiklau Nian Ji'an, Jizhijiang Syrup, Cherno, Watermelon Cream Lozenges, Salt Water Gargle, Citrus Bingmei Tablets, Sibi Chloramine Gargle  Can Qingyan Dropping Pills be used?

I don’t know if it was influenza A. My body temperature was the highest at that time, which was 37.3. This temperature lasted for two days. My throat hurt when I had a cold. I took loquat ointment and didn’t take any other medicine. I coughed occasionally at that time. The pain in Tianhou's throat is gone, but she still coughs occasionally. She doesn't cough at night, and it continues to this day. A while ago, she would cough a few times when she smelled the smell of cooking smoke during meals. I felt itchy in my trachea, so I went to the community hospital last week and was prescribed loquat capsules and compound methoxyphenamine capsules. After taking them for two days, I almost stopped coughing. However, I coughed again four days later, still coughing occasionally. I had an X-ray on May 18. , was diagnosed with bronchitis, the doctor prescribed two boxes of azithromycin, and Xuanfei Cough Mixture, and I continued to take compound methoxyphenamine. I heard that I took Aqi for three days and listened for four days, so now I only take Xuanfei Mixture for cough. It’s still the same. I had phlegm after taking the medicine prescribed on the 18th. After taking it for three days, there is no phlegm anymore. May I ask the doctor what treatment is needed next and whether I should take anti-inflammatory drugs because I have fungus and I don’t dare to take more. All antibiotics are given. Do I still need to take another X-ray? Is the interval too short?  I feel more coughing this afternoon than yesterday. Did you eat braised beef for lunch?

I don’t know if it was influenza A. My body temperature was the highest at that time, which was 37.3. This temperature lasted for two days. My throat hurt when I had a cold. I took loquat ointment and didn’t take any other medicine. I coughed occasionally at that time. The pain in Tianhou's throat is gone, but she still coughs occasionally. She doesn't cough at night, and it continues to this day. A while ago, she would cough a few times when she smelled the smell of cooking smoke during meals. I felt itchy in my trachea, so I went to the community hospital last week and was prescribed loquat capsules and compound methoxyphenamine capsules. After taking them for two days, I almost stopped coughing. However, I coughed again four days later, still coughing occasionally. I had an X-ray on May 18. , was diagnosed with bronchitis, the doctor prescribed two boxes of azithromycin, and Xuanfei Cough Mixture, and I continued to take compound methoxyphenamine. I heard that I took Aqi for three days and listened for four days, so now I only take Xuanfei Mixture for cough. It’s still the same. I had phlegm after taking the medicine prescribed on the 18th. After taking it for three days, there is no phlegm anymore. May I ask the doctor what treatment is needed next and whether I should take anti-inflammatory drugs because I have fungus and I don’t dare to take more. All antibiotics are given. Do I still need to take another X-ray? Is the interval too short?  I feel more coughing this afternoon than yesterday. Did you eat braised beef for lunch?

White phlegm, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and fatigue have always been a problem. I sought treatment from a local Chinese medicine doctor, but the effect was not good. I am 53 years old. I have been coughing with white phlegm for 5 or 6 years. My symptoms were mild at first, and I have had menopausal symptoms after taking Daly. Xinneng relieved the symptoms and had multiple CT scans, but the cough and white phlegm persisted. Later, a CT scan in June 2022 showed partial bronchiectasis on the right side. The respiratory department of the local hospital never gave a clear diagnosis. No lung CT was performed in 2023. , the overall situation is that the cough and white phlegm, chest tightness and shortness of breath have continued to worsen. In April, constant coughing and spitting at night caused otolithiasis, and then I was hospitalized. After taking Wuling Capsules, the coughing and spitting relieved for a period of time. In recent summer, I have been very uncomfortable again. I rested for an hour or two at night. When I woke up, I was sweating profusely, had chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughed, and vomited white sticky phlegm. I also had pain in the upper part of my right chest that lasted for about an hour. However, the symptoms subsided. If I continued to rest, the discomfort became worse than before. The tongue coating is thick and greasy with cracks in the middle, the mouth is sticky, and the appetite has decreased. I have to sleep 3-4 hours a day, and the quality is poor. I also have headaches and dizziness. My overall health continues to decline. Sometimes when I cough, I feel like my heart is going to come out. The dryness and stickiness in my mouth are obviously getting worse . The earliest CT examination also showed cord fibrosis . In the afternoon of the 2nd day, my throat and eyes felt dry, uncomfortable, and spittingchronic disease is emptydisease history is Nonesurgery history is emptyradiotherapy and chemotherapy history is emptyallergy history is Nonemajor illness is emptymedication usage is Banxialu granules, Suhuang cough capsules, Wuling capsules and Shihuida statins	62
