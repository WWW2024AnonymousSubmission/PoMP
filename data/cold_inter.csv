I took cefixime dispersible tablets. On the fourth day today, the fever has not gone away. I just took a temperature of 37.7 degrees. During this period, I had a fever of 39.4 degrees twice and took acetaminophen tablets twice. I did not take antipyretics at other times. I did a routine blood test on the 7th, see the picture for details. I would like to ask the doctor, will having a fever for four days cause damage to the body? Will the fever lead to pneumonia? Should I continue taking cephalosporins to relieve inflammation? Why hasn’t my fever gone away after taking Cephalosporin for four days? What should I do next with my medication?	allergy history is Allergic to penicillin, and also allergic to certain batches of cephalosporins	major illness is empty	1	16.0	180.0	59.0	cough	wanted help is  Will having a fever for four days cause damage to the body?
