If your condition requires long-term consultation and keeping in touch with me, you can choose this service and have emergency calls with me twice a month; avoid Unnecessary trips to and from the hospital are tiring. 4. If you are not used to these methods, you can come to the hospital for an interview with me. Online appointment for follow-up consultation 5. For old patients who visit our clinic and successfully register, I will provide 3 free consultation opportunities in the month after registration. Due to limited time and energy and the limitations of the Haodafu platform, a certain fee will be charged after 3 sessions. The consultation fee has been paid. I also hope that all patients will cherish the consultation opportunity and avoid unnecessary expenses.
