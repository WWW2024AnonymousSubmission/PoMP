In the same year, he worked at Beijing Anzhen Hospital. In 1993, he was promoted to deputy chief physician. In 1996, he went to the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to study for one year as a senior visiting scholar. In 1997, he was hired. He is the deputy director of cardiac surgery. He was promoted to chief physician in 1998 and hired as a doctoral supervisor in 2003. He has been engaged in cardiovascular surgery for more than 20 years and has performed nearly 10,000 independent operations, more than 800 cases every year. He established the Beijing Heart Transplantation and Valvular Surgery Diagnosis and Treatment Center.

He has performed more than 10,000 heart valve surgeries and has become friends with many patients. During my interactions with them, what touched me most was not their fear of surgery or their complaints about pain. Rather, after mitral valve replacement, especially for patients who have received artificial mechanical valve implantation, the quality of life has been reduced due to lifelong use of warfarin, life expectancy has been significantly reduced, cerebral hemorrhage and thrombosis are frequent, and the noise of the mechanical valve Can't sleep, etc. Valve replacement is relatively simple and hassle-free for surgeons, but it means permanent pain for patients. Therefore, my request to myself and my treatment team has always been to do our best to save all diseased mitral valves in our hands. The total repair rate should exceed 90%, so that they can continue to function normally. He has published more than 100 papers in SCI and domestic core journals. In 2013, he invented the first domestic three-dimensional mitral annuloplasty ring with utility model patents with intellectual property rights, and obtained a new utility patent certificate certified by the State Intellectual Property Office. As the first person in charge, he has undertaken more than ten projects at the provincial and ministerial levels and above, and also undertaken a number of National Natural Science Foundation projects and national 12th Five-Year Plan projects. His major works include ""Perioperative Management Manual of Cardiac Surgery"" (People's Military Medical Publishing House, 1999), ""Basics and Concepts of Mitral Valve Repair in Modern Adult Cardiac Surgery"" (Beijing Publishing House, 2005), ""Cardiac Surgery Quick Reference Manual"" (People's Military Medical Publishing House) Society, 2009) won the second prize of the Science and Technology Progress Award for Outstanding Scientific Research Achievements of Higher Education Institutions of the Ministry of Education in 2009, the third prize of the Beijing Science and Technology Progress Award for the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation in 2009, and the Mechanism of Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation in 2010. and intervention research won the second prize of the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Progress Award. In 2010, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau funded the ""Ten Hundred Thousand"" senior health talent ""Ten"" level talent training fund. As the subject leader of heart valve surgery, Professor Meng Xu leads an academic team that is the most influential leader in the field of valve surgery in China.
