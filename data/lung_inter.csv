Lung mass  Lung squamous cell carcinoma  Lung squamous cell carcinoma The eleventh immunotherapydisease description is On July 27, due to physical discomfort and back and neck pain, I had a physical examination in Fuxin City and a lung CT showed that the lungs were occupying space. On August 1, I continued to do enhanced CT. On August 3, I went to Shenyang Shengjing Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The doctor said that it would be better to treat it with Fule. During the anti-inflammatory period, I also developed chest pain on the 10th day after taking Chinese medicine. I stopped taking the medicine and coughed up blood. I stopped taking the medicine and had difficulty walking and holding my breath. On August 15, I was hospitalized in Shenyang Shengjing Hospital for a week. I had a full-body examination and a bronchoscopy to take pathology. On August 31, I did a genetic test to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer underwent the first immunotherapy in October 2022. The K drug was used because the patient with high immune expression resisted chemotherapy, so he used a single immunotherapy. So far, it has been the eleventh time. The tumor was 9 cm at the beginning and now it is 9 cm. 3 cm, but the size has not changed in the last three times. Yesterday’s CT scan showed a few millimeters of growth. The doctor said it might be drug-resistant and suggested changing to Cardonil. Finally, I would like to hear your suggestions.
