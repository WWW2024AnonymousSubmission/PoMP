The key level mainly refers to the largest diameter level of the small nodule. It is best to have the local doctor help you point it out. For patients with small nodules or ground-glass opacity, if the imaging data is from another hospital, it is best to have an electronic version of the CT film or go to an outpatient clinic. If it is stored on a CD or USB flash drive, it is best to bring your own computer or store the film in an IPAD (to save time). Due to the large number of surgeries, we may not be able to reply in time, please forgive me. It is recommended that you make an appointment for outpatient treatment so that I can give better diagnosis and treatment opinions."	67

Before seeing a doctor, it is recommended to read my first thirty popular science articles, which can improve your medical efficiency. There are detailed introductions to the diagnosis, treatment and subsequent prognosis of ground glass nodules. (There are about 70 popular science articles). Or buy the popular science monograph ""Don't Panic When You Encounter Ground Glass Nodules"" written by me on JD.com. For locally advanced lung cancer, if it shrinks or downstages after targeted therapy or chemotherapy, there is also a chance of surgery. The 2017 version is an overall introduction to ground glass nodules. It also includes an introduction to the judgment of benign GGO and malignant GGO, an introduction to whether GGO has symptoms, whether GGO will disappear, the growth rate of GGO, dietary precautions, etc. It is highly recommended to read the pulmonary hospital’s CT CT and treatment guide, hospitalization guide, why you should quit smoking before surgery, etc. Postoperative patients focus on post-operative precautions and post-discharge precautions. Patients with psychological shadows are recommended to read the psychological counseling articles. There are also 30 patients’ own stories for your reference. The key to effective diagnosis lies in clear electronic films, preferably 1-millimeter-layer films, target-scanned films, or electronic QR codes. Patients seeking medical treatment out of town can inquire about ""medical treatment in other places"" on WeChat or Alipay to handle hospitalization referral services. If it is a small nodule or a small ground glass nodule (lesion less than 2 cm), and if there is no electronic version of the film or a partially enlarged film, it is best to see my Yanqing Road Clinic on Wednesday afternoon for the first visit. It is best to do a CT scan one day in advance. , so as to solve the problem as quickly as possible. If you are planning to see a doctor, you can go to the Yanqing Road Clinic of our hospital one day in advance for a chest CT scan (the queue for CT at the Yanqing Road Clinic is faster and the address is No. 130 Yanqing Road, near the intersection of Yanqing Road and Huating Road), or you can have it done at the convenience clinic of the main hospital. Good CT (you can see the film on the same day after the CT scan without waiting for the report). It is more convenient to come to the outpatient clinic in the afternoon. Otherwise, you have to queue for several hours just to make a CT appointment. It is a waste of time, and the main hospital usually makes appointments on the same day. Less than CT. We remind patients who do not have CT films and only have CT paper reports to bring films from other hospitals or have a CT scan in our hospital before coming back for treatment, otherwise effective diagnosis cannot be provided. Our hospital currently provides online CT report and CT picture query services. Method: In WeChat, search for sph-1933, or Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, find it in the official account, then follow it, and then register. After registration, you can query our hospital’s CT report and see CT pictures. After seeing the CT film , you can click to share, and there will be a QR code. Upload this QR code, and others can see your films, or after the CT report comes out, provide your ID number and the mobile phone number used for registration. Doctor Your films can be found online. If you want to see clearer pictures, you can use the computer version of WeChat, and then open the CT pictures on your computer to see them more clearly. Before asking questions online for medical treatment, you must have high-quality films, otherwise we will not be able to provide effective consultation (especially for patients with small nodules). It is best to read my popular science article on how to treat ground glass nodules in the lungs. ""http://www.haodf.com/zhuanjiaguandian/kongdu_5526872998.htm"" Dr. Xie Dong, what should I do if I want to see you for surgery but can't get your number? Do I have to go to the outpatient clinic before being admitted to the hospital? Answer: You can leave me a message or call me on the Haodafu online platform, send me the key films, and leave the time period you wish to be hospitalized and your mobile phone number. If there is indeed an indication for surgery, I will arrange a queue for admission. No need. Be sure to come to the outpatient clinic for treatment. After waiting for admission, you can come directly to Shanghai to arrange admission to avoid long wait for hospitalization after coming to Shanghai. ***Treat every patient wholeheartedly to achieve our beliefs and mission*** When inquiring about your condition, it is best to upload the existing chest CT and other data at hand, so that we can provide you with more reasonable suggestions and consultations. For patients with pulmonary nodules, it is best to upload ""electronic films of key aspects."" The key level is the largest diameter level of the small nodule, which is best pointed out by a local doctor. Only by seeing the films of key aspects can we quickly judge whether the lesions are benign or malignant. For patients with small nodules or ground-glass opacity, it is best to upload an electronic version of the CT film or come to the outpatient clinic. If the film is too small to see clearly, you can burn it on a disk or USB flash drive. It is best to bring your own computer, or save the film on an IPAD. miles (save time). The time of treatment is very important. For nodules below 10mm that are discovered for the first time, it is recommended to come to our hospital for follow-up consultation at least 3 months later. This is because when first discovered, it is generally not possible to characterize it. Some inflammatory nodules will be absorbed or refractory after about 3 months. disappear. The vast majority of pulmonary nodules with a size of 3-4 mm are benign lesions, so there is no need to be too nervous. A CT scan can be performed once every six months to one year. The tiny nodules written on the CT report are generally this type of nodules. This type of patients can generally go to a local hospital for review, and it is not recommended to come to Shanghai for treatment. Most nodules of 5-6 mm are relatively safe, and only a few ground-glass nodules have a malignant risk. If a ground glass nodule of more than 10 mm exists for a long time (at least more than 3 months), you cannot ignore the disease and seek medical treatment as soon as possible. At present, only about 10-15% of ground-glass nodules found clinically are malignant lesions and require further diagnosis and treatment. Most patients only require regular follow-up. Don't be too nervous. Tracheal tumors, tracheal stenosis, huge thoracic tumors, pleural mesothelioma, thymoma, mediastinal neurogenic tumors, lung transplantation are emergency and severe surgeries, and it is not easy to call Dr. Ask my assistant to add a number on site. You are not alone when you are sick, because there are many people who care about you, and because this is everyone's business, then --- please let us all help you, and you just need to face it bravely. If you are satisfied with our work, please vote for us. At present, the diagnosis of ground-glass nodules in the lungs relies heavily on electronic films. Without electronic films, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the nature of the nodules. Some hospitals provide cloud imaging, and CT can be done at the local hospital.

Before seeing a doctor, it is recommended to read my first thirty popular science articles, which can improve your medical efficiency. There are detailed introductions to the diagnosis, treatment and subsequent prognosis of ground glass nodules. (There are about 70 popular science articles). Or buy the popular science monograph ""Don't Panic When You Encounter Ground Glass Nodules"" written by me on JD.com. For locally advanced lung cancer, if it shrinks or downstages after targeted therapy or chemotherapy, there is also a chance of surgery. The 2017 version is an overall introduction to ground glass nodules. It also includes an introduction to the judgment of benign GGO and malignant GGO, an introduction to whether GGO has symptoms, whether GGO will disappear, the growth rate of GGO, dietary precautions, etc. It is highly recommended to read the pulmonary hospital’s CT CT and treatment guide, hospitalization guide, why you should quit smoking before surgery, etc. Postoperative patients focus on post-operative precautions and post-discharge precautions. Patients with psychological shadows are recommended to read the psychological counseling articles. There are also 30 patients’ own stories for your reference. The key to effective diagnosis lies in clear electronic films, preferably 1-millimeter-layer films, target-scanned films, or electronic QR codes. Patients seeking medical treatment out of town can inquire about ""medical treatment in other places"" on WeChat or Alipay to handle hospitalization referral services. If it is a small nodule or a small ground glass nodule (lesion less than 2 cm), and if there is no electronic version of the film or a partially enlarged film, it is best to see my Yanqing Road Clinic on Wednesday afternoon for the first visit. It is best to do a CT scan one day in advance. , so as to solve the problem as quickly as possible. If you are planning to see a doctor, you can go to the Yanqing Road Clinic of our hospital one day in advance for a chest CT scan (the queue for CT at the Yanqing Road Clinic is faster and the address is No. 130 Yanqing Road, near the intersection of Yanqing Road and Huating Road), or you can have it done at the convenience clinic of the main hospital. Good CT (you can see the film on the same day after the CT scan without waiting for the report). It is more convenient to come to the outpatient clinic in the afternoon. Otherwise, you have to queue for several hours just to make a CT appointment. It is a waste of time, and the main hospital usually makes appointments on the same day. Less than CT. We remind patients who do not have CT films and only have CT paper reports to bring films from other hospitals or have a CT scan in our hospital before coming back for treatment, otherwise effective diagnosis cannot be provided. Our hospital currently provides online CT report and CT picture query services. Method: In WeChat, search for sph-1933, or Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, find it in the official account, then follow it, and then register. After registration, you can query our hospital’s CT report and see CT pictures. After seeing the CT film , you can click to share, and there will be a QR code. Upload this QR code, and others can see your films, or after the CT report comes out, provide your ID number and the mobile phone number used for registration. Doctor Your films can be found online. If you want to see clearer pictures, you can use the computer version of WeChat, and then open the CT pictures on your computer to see them more clearly. Before asking questions online for medical treatment, you must have high-quality films, otherwise we will not be able to provide effective consultation (especially for patients with small nodules). It is best to read my popular science article on how to treat ground glass nodules in the lungs. ""http://www.haodf.com/zhuanjiaguandian/kongdu_5526872998.htm"" Dr. Xie Dong, what should I do if I want to see you for surgery but can't get your number? Do I have to go to the outpatient clinic before being admitted to the hospital? Answer: You can leave me a message or call me on the Haodafu online platform, send me the key films, and leave the time period you wish to be hospitalized and your mobile phone number. If there is indeed an indication for surgery, I will arrange a queue for admission. No need. Be sure to come to the outpatient clinic for treatment. After waiting for admission, you can come directly to Shanghai to arrange admission to avoid long wait for hospitalization after coming to Shanghai. ***Treat every patient wholeheartedly to achieve our beliefs and mission*** When inquiring about your condition, it is best to upload the existing chest CT and other data at hand, so that we can provide you with more reasonable suggestions and consultations. For patients with pulmonary nodules, it is best to upload ""electronic films of key aspects."" The key level is the largest diameter level of the small nodule, which is best pointed out by a local doctor. Only by seeing the films of key aspects can we quickly judge whether the lesions are benign or malignant. For patients with small nodules or ground-glass opacity, it is best to upload an electronic version of the CT film or come to the outpatient clinic. If the film is too small to see clearly, you can burn it on a disk or USB flash drive. It is best to bring your own computer, or save the film on an IPAD. miles (save time). The time of treatment is very important. For nodules below 10mm that are discovered for the first time, it is recommended to come to our hospital for follow-up consultation at least 3 months later. This is because when first discovered, it is generally not possible to characterize it. Some inflammatory nodules will be absorbed or refractory after about 3 months. disappear. The vast majority of pulmonary nodules with a size of 3-4 mm are benign lesions, so there is no need to be too nervous. A CT scan can be performed once every six months to one year. The tiny nodules written on the CT report are generally this type of nodules. This type of patients can generally go to a local hospital for review, and it is not recommended to come to Shanghai for treatment. Most nodules of 5-6 mm are relatively safe, and only a few ground-glass nodules have a malignant risk. If a ground glass nodule of more than 10 mm exists for a long time (at least more than 3 months), you cannot ignore the disease and seek medical treatment as soon as possible. At present, only about 10-15% of ground-glass nodules found clinically are malignant lesions and require further diagnosis and treatment. Most patients only require regular follow-up. Don't be too nervous. Tracheal tumors, tracheal stenosis, huge thoracic tumors, pleural mesothelioma, thymoma, mediastinal neurogenic tumors, lung transplantation are emergency and severe surgeries, and it is not easy to call Dr. Ask my assistant to add a number on site. You are not alone when you are sick, because there are many people who care about you, and because this is everyone's business, then --- please let us all help you, and you just need to face it bravely. If you are satisfied with our work, please vote for us. At present, the diagnosis of ground-glass nodules in the lungs relies heavily on electronic films. Without electronic films, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the nature of the nodules. Some hospitals provide cloud imaging, and CT can be done at the local hospital.

Although most cancers currently have poor curative effects, research results are coming in spurts. How to get you or your patients the latest, most relevant and most effective personalized treatment. Enable patients to suffer less pain, avoid detours, and get the best treatment. This is the challenge of the times for both doctors and patients. Only doctors who abandon the temptation of fame and fortune, devote themselves to study and research, and seriously carry out clinical thinking and practice can successfully cure patients. So your trust is the ladder to healing. Online medical treatment serves as a supplement to outpatient clinics, and patient trust is the first step to successful treatment. I believe that no matter how difficult the disease is, the doctor you trust will find the most suitable road to recovery for you. Let us trust each other and work together!	89

Humanity has been plunged into infinite suffering due to tuberculosis. Since the discovery of anti-tuberculosis drugs in the 1940s and 1950s, especially the advent of rifampicin, mankind has once defeated this infectious disease that was once called the ""white plague.""
