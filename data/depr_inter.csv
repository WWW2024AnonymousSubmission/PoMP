Troubling you. As parents, we have always had some questions about our child's condition, whether he is manic or not. As children grow up, sometimes they are indeed outstanding. For example, when a child enters a key junior high school, the teacher of the junior high school recruits him by name at the primary school and proactively contacts our parents. Then he was admitted to a key high school. After entering high school, his grades were average. He only started studying in the second semester of his second year of high school, but his studies were all used on content outside the college entrance examination syllabus. For the learning content within the examination syllabus, he only listened to the teacher's lectures and completed homework, and did not spend any energy in this area. However, In terms of grades, he was usually ranked sixth or seventh in his grade, and it was beyond his own expectations. His college entrance examination results were good, but he was admitted with a score 40 points higher than the cutoff of the Chinese University of Hong Kong  based on his interest in learning and target study, and was approximately tied for 500th in the province. In the first semester after entering his freshman year, his motivation to study weakened. Although he was worried, he still easily achieved the results to get a scholarship. With this background, during his senior year in high school and his first semester in college, he did have a high opinion of himself. He felt that he was very smart and great. This was the mentality after comparing with his classmates. He felt full of confidence and recalled his study status at that time. It is true that my brain is very flexible and my learning ideas are indeed smooth. As parents, we do not understand why this situation, which has reasons and reasons, is regarded as a manifestation of the manic phase of bipolar disorder. In the second semester of school last January, the child took it lightly and spent all his energy on playing, especially online games, and started skipping classes. The courses in the first semester are mainly to deepen and improve on the basis of high school. Because he has a good foundation, he can still learn smoothly. The courses in the second semester have nothing to do with the content he studied in high school. , is a completely new beginning, and the teacher does not teach step-by-step like high school teachers. On the one hand, the children skip classes and cannot keep up with the progress. On the other hand, they feel that learning is extremely difficult and their intelligence is not enough. In addition, the school has begun to attach great importance to writing papers in the second semester. Often, homework is also a paper, and exams are also papers. Children are not used to this at all. Coupled with the long-standing procrastination of pursuing perfection, the homework cannot be completed and the paper cannot be completed. If it doesn’t work, I won’t be able to keep up with my studies. Under such circumstances, his confidence was greatly affected. He was always worried about not getting a scholarship. He considered the worst consequences in everything, and didn't know how to work hard. He also completely lost his goals and motivation for studying, and he also became inferior to others. , I feel inferior to my classmates everywhere and have no communication with my classmates, even though I feel lonely. During this period, a four-year relationship also ended. The breakup was caused by poor words and an inability to express feelings. This was also a blow to him. Every day, I play online games to anesthetize myself amid anxiety and depression, escaping from reality, and I have had fleeting thoughts of suicide. This state started in March this year. Finally, at the end of April, we discovered that his condition definitely met the criteria for being expelled from the school before the semester was over. Only then did we finally tell us the truth about his time at school, and we suspended him from school. It lasts for eight months. During the process of suspending school, we learned that we had received twelve psychological counseling sessions at the school’s psychological counseling center since entering the school, but to no avail. We were still anxious, depressed, and unable to find interest, motivation, or goals in learning. He was allowed to suspend school only after he was diagnosed with depression at a local hospital in Shenzhen and provided with proof of consultation records at school. To what extent do these symptoms correspond to the characteristics of depression? If the child has simple depression and is not bipolar, will the drugs quetiapine and magnesium propionate he takes have any therapeutic effect on depression? What will be the consequences? If the child is currently suffering from bipolar depression, will taking magnesium valproate worsen the depression? Can I combine some low-dose antidepressants?  To what extent can a child’s arrogance be defined as delusion of grandeur? Does quick thinking mean free thinking? There is no long-term sleeplessness, no frequent making of unachievable plans, no endless rhetoric, and no obvious increase in behavior. Can rebound after drug withdrawal be regarded as hypomania?  Since 2019, most of the children have been depressed and have never experienced obvious mania. No hallucinations, no delusional experiences. I once experienced lithium carbonate poisoning for more than three months, which disappeared after stopping the drug. At first glance, there are no other phenomena such as delusions of grandeur, random plans, anticlimactic results, sleepless nights and other phenomena. Currently, I am still mainly depressed.  The initial diagnosis process was very hurried. It only took three to five minutes. The doctor asked a few questions, including whether my brain was very flexible a year ago, whether I thought I was great, and nothing else. The hospital made its own scale, and the child reported that the answers were only yes and no, which was not enough to describe his condition. Later, the doctor also said that the medication should be stopped within two months and suggested that I switch to psychological treatment. During each follow-up visit, the child only said that he was thinking quickly, and the doctor said a lot of things, but there was no description to what extent.	allergy history is None  None  Lithium carbonate	major illness is empty	1	23.0	179.0	100.0	bipolar disorder	wanted help is  Reassess the condition.
