I always believe that an excellent psychiatrist must have beautiful humanity, rich humanistic knowledge, good talents and excellent professional qualities. With three hearts (patience, carefulness) , thoughtfulness) and the three powers (keen insight, understanding, and analysis) help you regain your beautiful soul when you are lost. Introduction to the Early Intervention Department of Guangzhou Brain Hospital: Early intervention, reappearing the beautiful mind. Imaging studies in recent years have shown that mental illness is a brain disease in which brain function and structure are damaged. The longer a mental illness lasts, the more severe the damage to the brain. Early identification and intervention can effectively shorten the onset of mental illness and reduce the damage to brain function, so it is of great significance to the long-term prognosis and maintenance of social functions of patients. Early intervention by Australia, the United States, etc. is at the forefront of the international community and has initially achieved good results. Our hospital also took the lead in establishing an early intervention department in China. Our Features Strong Technical Force Our department has strong technical force and the age structure of the medical team is reasonable. There are both older generation psychiatrists with rich clinical experience and young scientific researchers who are brave in academic exploration. There are currently 2 chief physicians, 3 deputy chief physicians, 2 doctors, and 5 masters (including those currently studying). 90% of young doctors graduated from key medical schools, and about 50% of nursing staff have a bachelor's degree or above. The proportion of medical staff per bed ranks first in the hospital, ensuring refined diagnosis and treatment services. Comprehensive professional services The clinical diagnosis, treatment and scientific research level of early intervention in our department are among the best in the country. We mainly treat patients with early-stage mental disorders (adolescents, first-episode, and disease duration less than 5 years), patients with mild mental disorders (such as neurosis, Insomnia, chronic pain), etc., provide patients with standardized systemic treatment, strive to achieve complete cure when the disease first occurs, to ensure a good long-term prognosis for patients, and strive to detect and intervene as early as possible before the disease relapses to control the development of the disease; At the same time, early screening and identification technology for psychotic disorders and mood disorders has been established to provide early consultation, assessment, intervention and follow-up services for high-risk groups with genetic risks and susceptibility predispositions, as well as prodromal patients with suspicious symptoms, and strive to Achieve early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment. Based on sophisticated and high-quality diagnosis and treatment services, patients in our department can recover as quickly as possible. The high recovery rate and short hospitalization period can greatly reduce the burden on patients and their families. More systematic psychotherapy is another feature of our department. On the basis of integrating undergraduate medical care, psychology department, rehabilitation department and other resources, our department has initially established a unique comprehensive psychological intervention model for inpatients. Provide inpatients with individual and group psychotherapy, social and problem-solving rehabilitation skills training, relaxation skills training, disease health education, weight-loss aerobics, yoga physical and mental adjustment training, psychological film and television appreciation, ward group fun activities, etc. Intervention services help patients improve their psychological adjustment and social adaptability, and encourage them to actively participate in treatment and rehabilitation. It not only implements the concept of biological-psychological-social all-round intervention, but also enriches patients' hospital life, with good results. Active academic atmosphere: Medical staff in our department conduct reading and study reports every week, exchange the latest research progress in the subject, regularly carry out new technology learning, and keep up with the forefront of subject development. Based on this, we will integrate research concepts into practice, actively use research to guide practice, and combine local characteristics to create a first-class professional technical team. Humanized management The doctor-nurse ratio for each bed in the ward is the highest in the hospital, and the level of refinement of services is much higher than that of general psychiatric departments. Our department adopts fully open management, and the environment is comfortable and warm. Each room is fully equipped with living facilities and is the psychiatric ward with the best hospitalization conditions in our hospital. Patients can be accompanied 24 hours a day, and can go out for walks freely after treatment to relieve the stress of hospitalization, and also contribute to the recovery of the disease and the recovery of social functions. Sincerity and love is our philosophy, and patient satisfaction is our unremitting pursuit.

I will treat every visitor sincerely. Things you need to pay attention to when seeking medical treatment online: 1. No matter how detailed the description of the condition is, it cannot replace the doctor's face-to-face assessment of the mental state. Therefore, you must meet with a doctor before confirming the diagnosis. 2. The Physician Law stipulates that medicine cannot be prescribed without seeing the patient. Therefore, it is best to have an evaluation in my outpatient clinic for the first time you see me. If you are treated in other hospitals, you need to upload the medical records of the treatments in other hospitals. 3. The disease is dynamic and requires multiple reviews and adjustments to medications. Just one visit to the doctor may not solve the problem. 4. Visitors who have been diagnosed and treated in person are recommended to ask questions according to the following steps. ① Take photos and upload your medical records. ② Accurately describe the name of the medicine you are taking (preferably the trade name), daily dose and method of taking it, the duration of taking the medicine and changes in the condition, including aspects that you are satisfied with and dissatisfied with. 5. If your condition changes, please communicate with me promptly and do not stop or reduce the medication on your own. 6. If you do not receive a reply in time, please wait patiently. You may be busy with other matters. You can also contact the platform to request refunds and other operations according to the rules, and it is recommended to seek medical treatment in a timely manner. 7. Psychotherapy needs everyone to understand: Psychotherapy is difficult to solve the problem in one session. The first diagnosis and treatment includes detailed questioning, examination and evaluation, etc. Please understand that the effect will be better if you have a comprehensive understanding. I wish you all good health soon!	8	expertise is Specialized in the diagnosis, treatment, and relapse prevention guidance of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, insomnia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, adolescent-related mental and psychological disorders and other mental illnesses.

Thank you all for your trust, support and attention to my personal website. I will treat every visitor sincerely. Things you need to pay attention to when seeking medical treatment online: 1. No matter how detailed the description of the condition is, it cannot replace the doctor's face-to-face assessment of the mental state. Therefore, you must meet with a doctor before confirming the diagnosis. 2. The Physician Law stipulates that medicine cannot be prescribed without seeing the patient. Therefore, it is best to have an evaluation in my outpatient clinic for the first time you see me. If you are treated in other hospitals, you need to upload the medical records of the treatments in other hospitals. 3. The disease is dynamic and requires multiple reviews and adjustments to medications. Just one visit to the doctor may not solve the problem. 4. Visitors who have been diagnosed and treated in person are recommended to ask questions according to the following steps. ① Take photos and upload your medical records. ② Accurately describe the name of the medicine you are taking (preferably the trade name), daily dose and method of taking it, the duration of taking the medicine and changes in the condition, including aspects that you are satisfied with and dissatisfied with. 5. If your condition changes, please communicate with me promptly and do not stop or reduce the medication on your own. 6. If you do not receive a reply in time, please wait patiently. You may be busy with other matters. You can also contact the platform to request refunds and other operations according to the rules, and it is recommended to seek medical treatment in a timely manner. 7. Psychotherapy needs everyone to understand: Psychotherapy is difficult to solve the problem in one session. The first diagnosis and treatment includes detailed questioning, examination and evaluation, etc. Please understand that the effect will be better if you have a comprehensive understanding. I wish you all good health soon!	71
