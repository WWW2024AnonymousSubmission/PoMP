Before seeing a doctor, it is recommended to read my first thirty popular science articles, which can improve your medical efficiency. There are detailed introductions to the diagnosis, treatment and subsequent prognosis of ground glass nodules. (There are about 70 popular science articles). Or buy the popular science monograph ""Don't Panic When You Encounter Ground Glass Nodules"" written by me on JD.com. For locally advanced lung cancer, if it shrinks or downstages after targeted therapy or chemotherapy, there is also a chance of surgery. The 2017 version is an overall introduction to ground glass nodules. It also includes an introduction to the judgment of benign GGO and malignant GGO, an introduction to whether GGO has symptoms, whether GGO will disappear, the growth rate of GGO, dietary precautions, etc. It is highly recommended to read the pulmonary hospital’s CT CT and treatment guide, hospitalization guide, why you should quit smoking before surgery, etc. Postoperative patients focus on post-operative precautions and post-discharge precautions. Patients with psychological shadows are recommended to read the psychological counseling articles. There are also 30 patients’ own stories for your reference. The key to effective diagnosis lies in clear electronic films, preferably 1-millimeter-layer films, target-scanned films, or electronic QR codes. Patients seeking medical treatment out of town can inquire about ""medical treatment in other places"" on WeChat or Alipay to handle hospitalization referral services. If it is a small nodule or a small ground glass nodule (lesion less than 2 cm), and if there is no electronic version of the film or a partially enlarged film, it is best to see my Yanqing Road Clinic on Wednesday afternoon for the first visit. It is best to do a CT scan one day in advance. , so as to solve the problem as quickly as possible. If you are planning to see a doctor, you can go to the Yanqing Road Clinic of our hospital one day in advance for a chest CT scan (the queue for CT at the Yanqing Road Clinic is faster and the address is No. 130 Yanqing Road, near the intersection of Yanqing Road and Huating Road), or you can have it done at the convenience clinic of the main hospital. Good CT (you can see the film on the same day after the CT scan without waiting for the report). It is more convenient to come to the outpatient clinic in the afternoon. Otherwise, you have to queue for several hours just to make a CT appointment. It is a waste of time, and the main hospital usually makes appointments on the same day. Less than CT. We remind patients who do not have CT films and only have CT paper reports to bring films from other hospitals or have a CT scan in our hospital before coming back for treatment, otherwise effective diagnosis cannot be provided. Our hospital currently provides online CT report and CT picture query services. Method: In WeChat, search for sph-1933, or Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, find it in the official account, then follow it, and then register. After registration, you can query our hospital’s CT report and see CT pictures. After seeing the CT film , you can click to share, and there will be a QR code. Upload this QR code, and others can see your films, or after the CT report comes out, provide your ID number and the mobile phone number used for registration. Doctor Your films can be found online. If you want to see clearer pictures, you can use the computer version of WeChat, and then open the CT pictures on your computer to see them more clearly. Before asking questions online for medical treatment, you must have high-quality films, otherwise we will not be able to provide effective consultation (especially for patients with small nodules). It is best to read my popular science article on how to treat ground glass nodules in the lungs. ""http://www.haodf.com/zhuanjiaguandian/kongdu_5526872998.htm"" Dr. Xie Dong, what should I do if I want to see you for surgery but can't get your number? Do I have to go to the outpatient clinic before being admitted to the hospital? Answer: You can leave me a message or call me on the Haodafu online platform, send me the key films, and leave the time period you wish to be hospitalized and your mobile phone number. If there is indeed an indication for surgery, I will arrange a queue for admission. No need. Be sure to come to the outpatient clinic for treatment. After waiting for admission, you can come directly to Shanghai to arrange admission to avoid long wait for hospitalization after coming to Shanghai. ***Treat every patient wholeheartedly to achieve our beliefs and mission*** When inquiring about your condition, it is best to upload the existing chest CT and other data at hand, so that we can provide you with more reasonable suggestions and consultations. For patients with pulmonary nodules, it is best to upload ""electronic films of key aspects."" The key level is the largest diameter level of the small nodule, which is best pointed out by a local doctor. Only by seeing the films of key aspects can we quickly judge whether the lesions are benign or malignant. For patients with small nodules or ground-glass opacity, it is best to upload an electronic version of the CT film or come to the outpatient clinic. If the film is too small to see clearly, you can burn it on a disk or USB flash drive. It is best to bring your own computer, or save the film on an IPAD. miles (save time). The time of treatment is very important. For nodules under 10mm that are discovered for the first time, it is recommended to come to our hospital for follow-up consultation at least 3 months later. This is because when first discovered, it is generally not possible to characterize it. Some inflammatory nodules will be absorbed or refractory after about 3 months. disappear. The vast majority of pulmonary nodules with a size of 3-4 mm are benign lesions, so there is no need to be too nervous. A CT scan can be performed once every six months to one year. The tiny nodules written on the CT report are generally this type of nodules. This type of patients can generally go to a local hospital for review, and it is not recommended to come to Shanghai for treatment. Most nodules of 5-6 mm are relatively safe, and only a few ground-glass nodules have a malignant risk. If a ground glass nodule of more than 10 mm exists for a long time (at least more than 3 months), you cannot ignore the disease and seek medical treatment as soon as possible. At present, only about 10-15% of ground-glass nodules found clinically are malignant lesions and require further diagnosis and treatment. Most patients only require regular follow-up.

Before seeing a doctor, it is recommended to read my first thirty popular science articles, which can improve your medical efficiency. There are detailed introductions to the diagnosis, treatment and subsequent prognosis of ground glass nodules. (There are about 70 popular science articles). Or buy the popular science monograph ""Don't Panic When You Encounter Ground Glass Nodules"" written by me on JD.com. For locally advanced lung cancer, if it shrinks or downstages after targeted therapy or chemotherapy, there is also a chance of surgery. The 2017 version is an overall introduction to ground glass nodules. It also includes an introduction to the judgment of benign GGO and malignant GGO, an introduction to whether GGO has symptoms, whether GGO will disappear, the growth rate of GGO, dietary precautions, etc. It is highly recommended to read the pulmonary hospital’s CT CT and treatment guide, hospitalization guide, why you should quit smoking before surgery, etc. Postoperative patients focus on post-operative precautions and post-discharge precautions. Patients with psychological shadows are recommended to read the psychological counseling articles. There are also 30 patients’ own stories for your reference. The key to effective diagnosis lies in clear electronic films, preferably 1-millimeter-layer films, target-scanned films, or electronic QR codes. Patients seeking medical treatment out of town can inquire about ""medical treatment in other places"" on WeChat or Alipay to handle hospitalization referral services. If it is a small nodule or a small ground glass nodule (lesion less than 2 cm), and if there is no electronic version of the film or a partially enlarged film, it is best to see my Yanqing Road Clinic on Wednesday afternoon for the first visit. It is best to do a CT scan one day in advance. , so as to solve the problem as quickly as possible. If you are planning to see a doctor, you can go to the Yanqing Road Clinic of our hospital one day in advance for a chest CT scan (the queue for CT at the Yanqing Road Clinic is faster and the address is No. 130 Yanqing Road, near the intersection of Yanqing Road and Huating Road), or you can have it done at the convenience clinic of the main hospital. Good CT (you can see the film on the same day after the CT scan without waiting for the report). It is more convenient to come to the outpatient clinic in the afternoon. Otherwise, you have to queue for several hours just to make a CT appointment. It is a waste of time, and the main hospital usually makes appointments on the same day. Less than CT. We remind patients who do not have CT films and only have CT paper reports to bring films from other hospitals or have a CT scan in our hospital before coming back for treatment, otherwise effective diagnosis cannot be provided. Our hospital currently provides online CT report and CT picture query services. Method: In WeChat, search for sph-1933, or Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, find it in the official account, then follow it, and then register. After registration, you can query our hospital’s CT report and see CT pictures. After seeing the CT film , you can click to share, and there will be a QR code. Upload this QR code, and others can see your films, or after the CT report comes out, provide your ID number and the mobile phone number used for registration. Doctor Your films can be found online. If you want to see clearer pictures, you can use the computer version of WeChat, and then open the CT pictures on your computer to see them more clearly. Before asking questions online for medical treatment, you must have high-quality films, otherwise we will not be able to provide effective consultation (especially for patients with small nodules). It is best to read my popular science article on how to treat ground glass nodules in the lungs. ""http://www.haodf.com/zhuanjiaguandian/kongdu_5526872998.htm"" Dr. Xie Dong, what should I do if I want to see you for surgery but can't get your number? Do I have to go to the outpatient clinic before being admitted to the hospital? Answer: You can leave me a message or call me on the Haodafu online platform, send me the key films, and leave the time period you wish to be hospitalized and your mobile phone number. If there is indeed an indication for surgery, I will arrange a queue for admission. No need. Be sure to come to the outpatient clinic for treatment.

It is best to provide clear image data for online consultation: if you have image data on a CD or USB flash drive, it is usually in DICOM format. It is recommended to upload the entire image data to the Haodafu online platform. This is the most recommended way to read image data. If it is film, it is recommended that the TV or computer screen be turned to white, with the highest brightness, as the background. The film should be flat and fixed on the screen, and you can use your mobile phone to focus and take pictures. If the small characters on the film can be clearly captured, it means that the film is fine. Take a very clear picture and then upload the original image. Warm reminder: If the photos taken by mobile phones are transmitted through WeChat without checking the original image, the image quality will be compressed, resulting in unclear display. Please refer to this. Face-to-face appointment registration: ""Inter-clinic appointment"" is an interface where I or other doctors in Beizhong can make an appointment for the patient's next visit. Usually, the appointment can be made within one month. Plus patients: Those who have made an appointment for a plus on Haodafu, or who have approved the plus by sending a private message to me, must first apply for a medical card on the day of treatment. If they already have a Beijing social security card, they must first contact the hospital for treatment at the manual window in the registration hall. After obtaining an ID number starting with T through the system, you can go to Clinic No. 9 on the second floor to apply for an additional number. Patients who have registered a plus number can get their number at the self-service machine or manual window, then undergo triage and wait for their number to be called for treatment. Patients with plus numbers need to wait to see the doctor in order (normal appointments are limited to 30 numbers, plus numbers need to be seen from the 31st). In order to avoid waiting for too long, it is recommended to come to the morning clinic between 10:00-10:50 To apply for an additional number, come to the afternoon outpatient clinic between 15:00-15:50.

It is best to provide clear image data for online consultation: if you have image data on a CD or USB flash drive, it is usually in DICOM format. It is recommended to upload the entire image data to the Haodafu online platform. This is the most recommended way to read image data. If it is film, it is recommended that the TV or computer screen be turned to white, with the highest brightness, as the background. The film should be flat and fixed on the screen, and you can use your mobile phone to focus and take pictures. If the small characters on the film can be clearly captured, it means that the film is fine. Take a very clear picture and then upload the original image. Warm reminder: If the photos taken by mobile phones are transmitted through WeChat without checking the original image, the image quality will be compressed, resulting in unclear display. Please refer to this. Face-to-face appointment registration: ""Inter-clinic appointment"" is an interface where I or other doctors in Beizhong can make an appointment for the patient's next visit. Usually, the appointment can be made within one month. Plus patients: Those who have made an appointment for a plus on Haodafu, or who have approved the plus by sending a private message to me, must first apply for a medical card on the day of treatment. If they already have a Beijing social security card, they must first contact the hospital for treatment at the manual window in the registration hall. After obtaining an ID number starting with T through the system, you can go to Clinic No. 9 on the second floor to apply for an additional number. Patients who have registered a plus number can get their number at the self-service machine or manual window, then undergo triage and wait for their number to be called for treatment. Patients with plus numbers need to wait to see the doctor in order (normal appointments are limited to 30 numbers, plus numbers need to be seen from the 31st). In order to avoid waiting for too long, it is recommended to come to the morning clinic between 10:00-10:50 To apply for an additional number, come to the afternoon outpatient clinic between 15:00-15:50. Warm reminder: The system cannot add numbers after 11 a.m. and 16 p.m. Please arrange the time for treatment with your family. Thank you very much for your cooperation. I wish all patients get medical treatment, a speedy recovery and a happy life!"	38

Welcome to my personal website, please fill in the complete information to receive it. Here you can communicate about thoracic surgery diseases and read articles in my popular science account. We will provide you with timely, accurate and effective guidance. If it is not convenient to come to the hospital, it is recommended to use ""online consultation"". Patients who want detailed answers and instant communication can apply for ""telephone consultation."" Patients with complicated conditions are invited to come to the hospital for consultation with me. For all patients who successfully register, I will provide 3 free consultation opportunities in the month after registration. Due to limited time and energy and the limitations of the Haodafu platform, after 3 times, a certain consultation fee will be charged according to regulations.

In 2021, under the leadership of Director Fu Xiangning, the mortality rate of our medical group was 0.1%, which is far lower than the national average (2.5%). For admitted patients, please read ""General Precautions Before and After Thoracic Surgery"" and ""Preoperative Instructions for Lungs, Esophagus and Mediastinum"" so that you can have a general understanding of the risks of surgery. The necessity, resectability and safety of surgery can only be determined after careful examination and evaluation after hospitalization. After determining the treatment plan, the doctor will explain your condition to you and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. Thoracic surgery itself carries high risks. Each patient's condition is different, and the patient's own risks vary greatly. Every patient needs to actively cooperate with their family members and doctors to work hard to recover. This is also the original intention of providing so many popular science articles. This platform can guide patients in standardized treatment and review from pre-hospitalization to post-discharge, using international guidelines as the criterion to provide standardized and scientific services throughout the process. Postoperative patients should read the post-operative recovery precautions to understand the causes and treatments of post-operative pain, cough, hemoptysis, incision numbness, and wheezing, so as to recover as quickly as possible, eliminate many doubts, and be well-informed! Discharged patients are required to visit our outpatient clinic within one month after the operation, bringing with them the thoracic surgery discharge records and previous examination results to evaluate the postoperative recovery, formulate a review plan and consolidate the treatment plan. It needs to be emphasized that for patients with intermediate and advanced tumors, if they do not receive timely consolidation treatment after surgery, the tumors will easily metastasize or relapse. I can also serve as a bridge, contacting oncology professors, making bed reservations, and working with oncology professors to guide patients on postoperative adjuvant treatment. You can download the ""Tongji Mobile"" app and consult the thoracic surgery department with pictures and texts in Tongji Cloud Medicine. Or pay attention to ""Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"" and consult the thoracic surgery department with pictures and texts in smart medical care.

Welcome to my personal website, please fill in the complete information to receive it. Here you can communicate about thoracic surgery diseases and read articles in my popular science account. We will provide you with timely, accurate and effective guidance. If it is not convenient to come to the hospital, it is recommended to use ""online consultation"". Patients who want detailed answers and instant communication can apply for ""telephone consultation."" Patients with complicated conditions are invited to come to the hospital for consultation with me. For all patients who successfully register, I will provide 3 free consultation opportunities in the month after registration. Due to limited time and energy and the limitations of the Haodafu platform, after 3 times, a certain consultation fee will be charged according to regulations. We have accumulated a lot of experience in thoracic surgery over a long period of time, and our team performs more than 1,000 surgeries annually. With high surgical attainments, he won the championship in the lobectomy youth group of the Southern District (seven provinces) of the first China Thoracic Surgery Standard and Innovative Surgery Summit Exhibition and the third place in the national finals. In 2021, under the leadership of Director Fu Xiangning, the mortality rate of our medical group was 0.1%, which is far lower than the national average (2.5%). For admitted patients, please read ""General Precautions Before and After Thoracic Surgery"" and ""Preoperative Instructions for Lungs, Esophagus and Mediastinum"" so that you can have a general understanding of the risks of surgery. The necessity, resectability and safety of surgery can only be determined after careful examination and evaluation after hospitalization. After determining the treatment plan, the doctor will explain your condition to you and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. Thoracic surgery itself carries high risks. Each patient's condition is different, and the patient's own risks vary greatly. Every patient needs to actively cooperate with their family members and doctors to work hard to recover. This is also the original intention of providing so many popular science articles. This platform can guide patients in standardized treatment and review from pre-hospitalization to post-discharge, using international guidelines as the criterion to provide standardized and scientific services throughout the process. Postoperative patients should read the post-operative recovery precautions to understand the causes and treatments of post-operative pain, cough, hemoptysis, incision numbness, and wheezing, so as to recover as quickly as possible, eliminate many doubts, and be well-informed! Discharged patients are required to visit our outpatient clinic within one month after the operation, bringing with them the thoracic surgery discharge records and previous examination results to evaluate the postoperative recovery, formulate a review plan and consolidate the treatment plan. It needs to be emphasized that for patients with intermediate and advanced tumors, if they do not receive timely consolidation treatment after surgery, the tumors will easily metastasize or relapse. I can also serve as a bridge, contacting oncology professors, making bed reservations, and working with oncology professors to guide patients on postoperative adjuvant treatment. You can download the ""Tongji Mobile"" app and consult the thoracic surgery department with pictures and texts in Tongji Cloud Medicine. Or pay attention to ""Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology"" and consult the thoracic surgery department with pictures and texts in smart medical care. We will provide you with check-ups, consultations, and medicines (delivered to your home by the hospital pharmacy). Welcome everyone to follow my WeChat public account ""Thoracic Surgery Doctor"" to learn about COVID-19 and health-related science knowledge. My expert clinic is on the 5th floor of the outpatient building of Wuhan Tongji Hospital, Hankou Campus, on Tuesday afternoon and Friday morning. We work together for your health!"	49

You need to listen to the truth. I have many offline patients who fell into a trap as soon as they walked out of the hospital after surgery. I also have a good friend whose relative almost suffered a serious setback in another hospital due to lung cancer. After practicing medicine for a long time, many patients have similar doubts and confusions, and I wonder why no one has answered them. This is the original intention that led me to establish an Internet clinic. [Did you know] Most of the nodules on the lungs are benign, and there are also quite a few cases of malignant nodules that do not require immediate surgical treatment (you heard that right). Health is very important, but life is not only about health. If you ask me, I will consider your condition, mentality and stage of life, and give my suggestions carefully - I dare not say that this is a perfect plan, but Please be worthy of my original intention of practicing medicine.

He specializes in surgical operations for thoracic tumors such as esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and mediastinal tumors, as well as minimally invasive surgeries such as thoracoscopy and mediastinoscopy. Special emphasis is placed on standardized surgical treatment of thoracic tumors, emphasizing the efficacy of surgery while also focusing on preventing surgical complications. Competent in various surgical procedures for esophageal cancer resection and lung cancer surgery, including thoracoscopic esophageal cancer surgery and lung cancer surgery. He is very interested in difficult and complicated diseases in thoracic surgery. He is the first to inject sclerosing agent through fiberoptic bronchoscope to treat bronchopleural fistula after surgery. The effective rate is 70%, which saves patients the pain and risk of re-operation. He also proposes postoperative bronchopleural fistula. It should be dealt with as early as possible and cannot just be conservative and watch and wait. It was the first to carry out thoracoscopic thoracoscopic orthopedic surgery for pectus excavatum (Nuss surgery) in older children (15-20 years old). The surgical incision is only about 2cm, which is less invasive and more beautiful than traditional surgery. In recent years, clinical work on lung transplantation has begun. Mainly engaged in molecular biology research and gene therapy research on lung cancer and esophageal cancer.scientific payoffs is He has successively conducted experimental research on radioimmunotherapy for lung cancer (this subject is a project funded by the National Natural Science Foundation), clinical research on the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family in esophageal cancer, and the role of HER4-mediated signaling pathways in the metastasis of esophageal cancer. Research on the mechanism of action and its diagnosis and treatment (Fudan Youth Fund Project), research on the in vitro apoptosis of lung cancer cells and in vivo targeted therapy of Survivin mutant genes, etc. Participated in the compilation of ""Pleural Diseases"", ""Practical Surgery"", ""Modern Surgery"", ""Clinical Surgery"", ""Practical Pediatric Surgery"", ""Da Ci Hai Medical Edition"" and other books.

Single-port and subxiphoid single-port thoracoscopy and robot-assisted surgery are used to treat various lung diseases such as lung cancer, pulmonary nodules, and mediastinal tumors.	individual resume is Zhao Deping, MD, chief physician of thoracic surgery, associate professor, doctoral supervisor, and postdoctoral co-supervisor. Deputy administrative director (in charge) of the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University, and head of the subspecialty of mediastinal diseases. From 2006.7 to 2007.9, he studied thoracic surgery techniques such as thoracoscopic surgery in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Mayo Clinic Medical Center and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the United States. In 2011, he won the Silver Snake Award Nomination Award, the highest honor for young talents in the Shanghai health system. In 2015, he won the only highest award - Excellence Award in the AME-Medtronic National Thoracoscopic Pulmonary Resection Surgery Video Competition. He has been working in the Thoracic Surgery Department of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital since 1997. He has been engaged in clinical work in thoracic surgery for more than 20 years. His personal annual operation volume is more than 1,500 cases, ranking among the top in the country. He specializes in the treatment of various lung diseases such as early stage lung cancer and mediastinal tumors using robots and single-port and subxiphoid single-port thoracoscopy. In 2013, he was one of the first experts in China to perform single-port thoracoscopic lobectomy. In 2014, the first case of subxiphoid single-port thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed in China. The relevant surgical experience and videos have been introduced and demonstrated at international and domestic conferences many times. Subxiphoid thoracoscopic surgery is suitable for the treatment of early-stage lung cancer and other lung diseases. Since it does not damage the ribs and intercostal nerves, subxiphoid single-port thoracoscopic surgery greatly reduces short-term and long-term postoperative wound pain, skin numbness and other problems. , especially suitable for early stage lung cancer, bilateral pulmonary nodules, pulmonary bullae, bilateral pneumothorax and other diseases. Moreover, bilateral lung lesions can be treated through an incision of only about 3-4CM, avoiding the pain of bilateral thoracotomy in conventional surgery. He specializes in robotic surgery to treat various difficult diseases of the lungs and mediastinum, and ranks among the top in the country in terms of monthly surgery volume. In February 2021, he performed the world's first single-operating hole robotic lobe sleeve resection. Robotic surgery is clearer than ordinary thoracoscopy because of its three-dimensional field of view and higher magnification. The flexible operating arm rotation angle can reach 270 degrees, far beyond that of human hands, and it can filter out the tremor of human hands. It is especially suitable for complex lung and mediastinal tumor surgeries, with lower surgical risks and more thorough lymph node dissection.	scientific payoffs is Published more than 20 papers.

The purpose of cancer treatment is to prolong the lives of cancer patients and improve their quality of life. For patients in the middle and late stages of life, the most important thing is to be able to prolong their lives relatively and enjoy their time with dignity. Cancer treatment is a worldwide problem. It is the doctor's responsibility to provide patients and their families with sufficient medical professional information, so that the patients (or their families) can choose which treatment to receive, and finally the doctors implement the treatment plan. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to pursue a career in interventional oncology. I hope my efforts can solve some practical problems for my patients."	162

Medical knowledge but don't use it to challenge the doctor. The best reason to be a good patient is to think about yourself. If the doctor can talk to you easily and freely, then you will gain more than getting free medicine and you will get better medical services. Doctors can work better because of the trust of patients. In a relaxed atmosphere, they can arouse many good ideas and are more likely to accept small or even subconscious things.

In 2006, the American ""Time"" magazine published a column written by Hai, a private doctor in New York, on its website - ""How to be a good patient?"" 》(What Makes a Good Patient?). According to Dr. Hai, a good patient should have the following characteristics: listen carefully, ask useful questions, communicate well and effectively with the doctor, respect and trust the doctor, have reasonable expectations for the treatment results, and have certain abilities. Medical knowledge but don't use it to challenge the doctor. The best reason to be a good patient is to think about yourself. If the doctor can talk to you easily and freely, then you will gain more than getting free medicine and you will get better medical services. Doctors can work better because of the trust of patients. In a relaxed atmosphere, they can arouse many good ideas and are more likely to accept small or even subconscious things. However, being a good patient does not mean that you only have to think about yourself. We spend 60 hours a week thinking about patients, giving up 20 hours of our personal time. Why can't patients show a little respect and care to their doctors? It's not difficult."	206

In clinical work, he pays special attention to the follow-up work of patients after treatment, constantly summarizes the experience and lessons of Gamma Knife treatment, and has accumulated rich experience in Gamma Knife treatment. From August 2000 to August 2001, he received a public study abroad grant and went to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London, University of London to study neurosurgery. During his further studies at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, he studied neurosurgery with David Thomas, a world-renowned professor of neurosurgery and vice president of the World Federation of Neurosurgery. The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery is the UK's most renowned neurosurgery centre. After returning to China, we will do a lot of follow-up work on patients treated with Gamma Knife and summarize the experience and lessons learned from Gamma Knife treatment. In 2005, the paper ""Long-term Efficacy of Gamma Knife in the Treatment of Trigeminal Schwannoma"" co-authored with Professor Pan Li was published in the Journal of Neurosurgery. In 2009, this paper was rated as one of the top 25 most cited papers on Gamma Knife treatment in the world. More than 7,000 patients have participated in Gamma Knife treatment. Gamma Knife is used to treat acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors, brain metastases, trigeminal schwannoma, hemangioblastoma, nasopharyngeal fibroangioma, chordoma, cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM), trigeminal neuralgia, We have accumulated rich experience in craniopharyngioma, jugular foramen area tumors (glomus jugular tumor, schwannoma), etc. At the end of 2007, I started working on Cyber ​​Knife treatment. I applied my existing experience in Gamma Knife treatment to Cyber ​​Knife treatment, and used the strengths and weaknesses to give full play to the advantages of Cyber ​​Knife. In the past 8 years, I have treated more than 5,500 cases of radiotherapy. He quickly became an expert in treating tumors with Cyber ​​Knife. From October to December 2015, I went to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Cyber ​​Knife Center in Philadelphia to learn new technologies of Cyber ​​Knife. I also visited the Cyber ​​Knife Centers of many well-known hospitals. Cyberknife treats meningiomas, acoustic neuromas, brain metastases, pituitary tumors, trigeminal schwannoma, glioma, chordoma, jugular foramen tumors (glomus jugular tumor, schwannoma), and nasopharyngeal fibrosis Hemangiomas, craniopharyngiomas, intraspinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), small tumors around the spinal cord, meningeal arteriovenous fistulas, cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), pineal region tumors, cavernous sinus cavernous hemangioma, blood vessels We have accumulated rich experience in blastoma and other aspects.

The process of applying for my family doctor is as follows (two methods): You can scan the QR code to follow my website through WeChat or download the Haodafu patient version client, search for my name, find my website, and apply for me to be your family doctor , you can consult and communicate with me about your condition. Message: The diagnosis of cancer is a science, and whether a diagnosis can be quickly and accurately determined depends on the skill and level of a doctor. Cancer treatment is an art, and whether it can be treated scientifically, reasonably and appropriately depends on a doctor's conscience and morality. The doctor-patient relationship is built online, which is our fate! I am willing to use the knowledge I have learned, all my experience, my sincerity, and my best to provide selfless service and help to those who are destined to do so. First line: If there is love in the heart, cancer will not be cancer; Second line: If there is no love in the heart, cancer will be added to the cancer. Hengpi: Love comes and cancer goes"	270

Through exchanges with Professor Krasna, a well-known international thoracic surgery expert in Maryland, USA, and Professor D'Amico, an internationally renowned expert in Duke University, USA, and Chairman of the American Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, in recent years, minimally invasive surgery such as thoracoscopy and mediastinoscopy has become a trend. Invasive surgical technology has developed rapidly in the Thoracic Surgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital, and has truly moved closer to the international advanced ranks in minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive chest surgery to treat chest diseases has become a new professional feature of the department. Currently, myasthenia gravis, mediastinal tumors, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hiatal hernia, achalasia and other esophageal functional diseases can all be successfully treated with minimally invasive surgical techniques. Among them, the number of cases of thoracoscopic treatment of myasthenia gravis and mediastinal tumors ranks first in the country, and the number of cases of thoracoscopic lobectomy, thoracoscopic and laparoscopic combined with radical esophageal cancer treatment, thoracoscopic esophageal benign tumor resection, laparoscopic treatment of hiatal hernia, achalasia and thoracoscopy Sympathotomy and other procedures are at the forefront of the country. Although these laparoscopic surgeries are difficult to operate, laparoscopic surgeries cause little damage to patients, have reliable therapeutic effects, and have minimal impact on the patient's body after surgery, so they have become increasingly accepted by the majority of patients. Department Features 1. Thoracoscopic surgery for the treatment of myasthenia gravis and mediastinal tumors. 2. Diagnosis and comprehensive treatment of benign esophageal diseases—gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, and achalasia, including laparoscopic surgery to treat hiatal hernia and achalasia. 3. Treat lung cancer with thoracoscopic lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. 4. Thoracic and laparoscopic combined radical treatment of esophageal cancer. 5. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy for the treatment of hyperhidrosis of the hands. 6.

Through exchanges with Professor Krasna, a well-known international thoracic surgery expert in Maryland, USA, and Professor D'Amico, an internationally renowned expert in Duke University, USA, and Chairman of the American Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, in recent years, minimally invasive surgery such as thoracoscopy and mediastinoscopy has become a trend. Invasive surgical technology has developed rapidly in the Thoracic Surgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital, and has truly moved closer to the international advanced ranks in minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive chest surgery to treat chest diseases has become a new professional feature of the department. Currently, myasthenia gravis, mediastinal tumors, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, hiatal hernia, achalasia and other esophageal functional diseases can all be successfully treated with minimally invasive surgical techniques. Among them, the number of cases of thoracoscopic treatment of myasthenia gravis and mediastinal tumors ranks first in the country, and the number of cases of thoracoscopic lobectomy, thoracoscopic and laparoscopic combined with radical esophageal cancer treatment, thoracoscopic esophageal benign tumor resection, laparoscopic treatment of hiatal hernia, achalasia and thoracoscopy Sympathotomy and other procedures are at the forefront of the country. Although these laparoscopic surgeries are difficult to operate, laparoscopic surgeries cause little damage to patients, have reliable therapeutic effects, and have minimal impact on the patient's body after surgery, so they have become increasingly accepted by the majority of patients. Department Features 1. Thoracoscopic surgery for the treatment of myasthenia gravis and mediastinal tumors. 2. Diagnosis and comprehensive treatment of benign esophageal diseases—gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, and achalasia, including laparoscopic surgery to treat hiatal hernia and achalasia. 3. Treat lung cancer with thoracoscopic lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection. 4. Thoracic and laparoscopic combined radical treatment of esophageal cancer. 5. Thoracoscopic sympathectomy for the treatment of hyperhidrosis of the hands. 6. Diagnosis and treatment of mediastinal diseases by mediastinoscopy."	284
